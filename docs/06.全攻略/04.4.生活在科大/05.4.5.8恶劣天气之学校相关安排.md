You may also visit [here](https://cso.ust.hk/cat/bad_wea) to learn more about the details of campus catering arrangement under adverse weather conditions.
    
    In addition, the campus supermarket (Fusion) and convenience store (7-Eleven) will remain open during the hoisting of Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 to offer limited service but will be closed if the pre-warning of Signal No. 9 or above is announced. Again, please visit [here](https://cso.ust.hk/shp/bad_wea) for more information.  Bookstore and hair salon will be closed when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above is hoisted.

The campus supermarket (Fusion) will also secure a sufficient supply of food and drinks beforehand to accommodate the needs.

    Dear colleagues and students,
    
    The Severe Tropical Storm Ma-on was estimated to be about 410 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong at 2 p.m. [The Hong Kong Observatory](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/index.html) has hoisted the Strong Wind Signal Number 3, and will consider issuing the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. today.
    
    University members are reminded to take the following precautions.
    
    1. Keep windows in offices and lab areas closed during periods of strong wind, heavy rainfall, and ensure that they are securely closed before leaving from work. Tape up large panes of glass facing into the storm.
    2. Occupants of staff quarters should keep all windows closed and secure all loose objects away from the balconies or other open areas. Tape up large panes of glass facing into the storm. Those who live on the bottom floor should check for blockage of the drainage inlet. Those who live on the top floor should ensure that the canopies are securely closed.
    3. Offices responsible for construction work should make necessary arrangements to ensure that all temporary structures such as scaffolds are adequately secured or taken down. Loose objects should be removed to safe places.
    4. Newcomers to Hong Kong are reminded that during Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal Number 8 or higher, stores will be closed and most transportation will cease to operate. It is advisable to stock sufficient food items at home and to make advance arrangement for transport if you must go out during the storm. The CMO typhoon response team will standby to address any campus emergency.
    
    DSTO will co-ordinate precautionary measures at the student dormitories and at outdoor sports facilities. Organizers of student activities in open areas should ensure loose objects and materials are tied up and secured.
    
    Whenever Warning Signal Number 8 or higher is hoisted, the seafront area will be closed to ensure safety.
